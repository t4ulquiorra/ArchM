**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed a crash that occurred when adding a song to a playlist, album, or artist before it was fully loaded.
- Fixed a crash caused by outdated saved settings after an app update; the app now falls back to a safe default instead of crashing.
- Fixed Spotify login issues where signing in with Google, Apple, or Facebook could show a black screen or fail to complete.
- Fixed the "Update Available" dialog not matching the app's overall theme and styling.

**Design Improvements**
- Updated input fields and dialog buttons (including in Spotify Import) to use a more rounded, modern look consistent with Material You design.

**Other Changes**
- Updated select app components to their latest stable versions for improved reliability.

I am pleased to announce the initial release of the updated Echo Music repository.

Recently, the project was subjected to a legal takedown notice. Since then, I have taken all necessary actions and made the required adjustments to the codebase and documentation to ensure full legal compliance. 

With these changes complete, I am excited to restore access to the project. I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to all of you for your unwavering support and patience during this period. Thank you for standing by me.
